Questions:

1. Why did you choose the topic.

	- I chose this topic because I would like to have my own webpage about selling music (albums, singles...) and promotion of artist.

2. Who is the target audience for this website.

	- the target audience for this website are people about 16 to 30-35 years old who likes hip-hop music and the new waves of  this genre.

3. Describe the webpage as if you where describing it to a blind person: Point the implementation
of the different requirements.

	- This webpage is about selling cds and to have information of these too. 
It has a simple design with a navigation bar on the top where you can choose between different sections (home, albums and about), 
a carousel of photos in the middle of the web that allows to show different album covers of the webapge, 
then you can find the "most selling albums" section where you can buy it them. 
In the bottom of the page there are the news section where you can find new singles update, 
concerts and some interesting videos and so the social media pages (Twitter, IG and Youtube).

4. Interesting features of the webpage/ most difficult aspect of creating the webpage/ any obstacles
you encountered.
	
	- One of the difficult aspect that I found is about put the top section fixed without no bother to the carousel section down below. 
Others difficulties would be put some photos on specific places, split the news section in three differents parts and the design of the multi-collapse div. 
That's some examples that I found most difficult.

5. Conclusion - What have you learned as result of doing this exercise?
	
	- In conclusion, what i learned the most it's how to use CSS and Bootstrap on the same page and many other functions about Bootstrap 
(like the navbar, collapse sections, buttoms) and so with the responsive design. Another thing that I learned it's how to better formularies with Bootstrap 
and the differents section that a webpage must have (folders section, images...) .
